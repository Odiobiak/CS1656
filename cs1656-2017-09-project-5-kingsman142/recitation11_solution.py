# ## Recitation 11: Cypher+Neo4j+Python
# ---
# In this recitation, we will query a Neo4j graph database using with Cypher language and Python.
# 
# Neo4j is a highly scalable, native graph database purpose-built to leverage not only data but also its relationships.
# 
# Cypher is a declarative graph query language that allows for expressive and efficient querying and updating of the graph store.

# In[1]:

from neo4j.v1 import GraphDatabase

#Connect to the database
driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost", encrypted=False)

#Start new session
session = driver.session()

#Start new transaction
transaction = session.begin_transaction()


# ### Queries
# __Q1) List any 10 actor names.__

# In[3]:
